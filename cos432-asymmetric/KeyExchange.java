 * complete:
 *  1.  Call {@code prepareOutMessage} on the first participant, and send the result to the other participant.
 *  2.  Receive the result of the second participant's {@code prepareOutMessage}, and pass it into the first
 *      participant's {@code processInMessage} method.
 * The process can happen in an arbitrary order of participants (i.e., it doesn't matter which participant is first).
 * They could even happen concurrently in two separate threads. However, your code must work regardless of the order of
 * participants.
